# Coding Quiz - Basic JS
## Description
This application presents the user with a short, timed, multiple-choice quiz about JavaScript basics.  When the user clicks a button on the first screen to start the quiz a timer appears on the page and begins counting down.  After the final question, the user receives information about how many questions were answered correctly. If time runs down before all questions are answered, the quiz is over. Total score is figured by adding ten points for each correct answer with the number of remaining seconds on the countdown.  The user can add their name and score to a leaderboard, which is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.  Multiple users can play on the same computer and see their scores listed from high to low on the the leaderboard page.
